GM.Help	= [[Prop Hunt is a twist on the classic backyard game Hide and Seek.

As a Prop you have to replicate an existing prop on the map and then find a good hiding spot. Use your fire button or [E] to replicate the prop you are looking at. Your health is scaled based on the size of the prop you replicate.

As a Hunter you will eventually be blindfolded for the first few seconds. When your blindfold is taken off, you will need to find props controlled by players and kill them. Damaging non-player props will lower your health significantly. However, killing a Prop will increase your health.

Both teams can press [F3] to play a taunt sound.]]
